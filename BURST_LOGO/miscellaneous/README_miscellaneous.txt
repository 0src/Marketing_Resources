----------
The Burst B alone is not the logo or the icon. It must not be used as such in place of the Burst logo or icon.
The logo and icon can be found in the SVG and PNG folders.
The Burst B is provided here in case it is needed for any graphic work such as favicons, fanarts, promotional images where it fits better than the full logo or icon.
The Burst Visual Identity Guide also applies to the Burst B. Please read it before using it.
